            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>1. In this lesson, I developed a basic understanding of HTML syntax and how to structure it to achieve the desired text layout.</p>
            <p>2. I learned how different English words are used in HTML to achieve specific results. Understanding the reasons behind these choices was particularly insightful.</p>
            <p>3. I also came to understand the step by step process of troubleshooting, ensuring that each piece of code was in the correct place to make the entire code function properly.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Aside from the specifics of coding HTML, I gained an understanding of the overall process and the terminology associated with HTML syntax. I found helpful information in these two links:</li>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>1. In this lesson, I developed a basic understanding of how to intergrate CSS code for styling into HTML syntax and how to structure it to achieve the desired text layout.</p>
            <p>2. I learned the various terminologies used for pieces of CSS' syntax, as well as how to constructing styles for webpages. Understanding the reasons behind these choices was particularly insightful.</p>
            <p>3. Since last Lab, I further developed my understanding of how to troubleshoot styling, occasions where my intended design wasnt showing up on the webpage lead me to look into the details of my code and edit where neccessary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS styling has proved indubitably useful in constructing webpages with HTML. I found helpful information in these two links:</li>
