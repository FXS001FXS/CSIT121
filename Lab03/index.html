            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>1. In this lesson, I developed a basic understanding of HTML syntax and how to structure it to achieve the desired text layout.</p>
            <p>2. I learned how different English words are used in HTML to achieve specific results. Understanding the reasons behind these choices was particularly insightful.</p>
            <p>3. I also came to understand the step-by-step process of troubleshooting, ensuring that each piece of code was in the correct place to make the entire code function properly.</p>

            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>1. In this lesson, I developed a basic understanding of how to integrate CSS code for styling into HTML syntax and how to structure it to achieve the desired text layout.</p>
            <p>2. I learned the various terminologies used for pieces of CSS syntax, as well as how to construct styles for webpages. Understanding the means if implementing my design choices was particularly insightful.</p>
            <p>3. Since the last lab, I further developed my understanding of how to troubleshoot the styling process. Occasions where my intended design wasn't showing up on the webpage led me to look into the details of my code and edit where necessary.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>CSS styling has proved indubitably useful in constructing webpages with HTML. I found helpful information in these two links:</li>
