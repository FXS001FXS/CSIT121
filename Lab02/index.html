        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <p>1. In this lesson I developed what is likely basic understanding of html syntax, and how to structure the syntax to achieve desired structure of text.
        <p>2. I learned how different english words are used in html to achieve certain results. Ensuring I understand why these words are used was especially inciteful
        <p>3. I learned how to problem solve step by step along the way, ensuring each pairing of code was in its correct place to ensure the code as a whole would function.</p>
        <ul>
