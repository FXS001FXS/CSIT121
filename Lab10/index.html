        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>In its simplest terms, Web of Things (WoT) Discovery regards the identifying and accessing of Internet of Things devices on a single network enviroment, allowing fluent interaction between their systems. Essentially, this allows internet connectivity with physical devices that would otherwise lack it through standardized web protocols.</p>
        <p>As for Discovery in particular, regarding WoT, the main goal is to ensure that intergrated devices automatically identify like devices on a network with little need for manual intervention. This is crucial simply because when upscaling the amount of devices in an environment/ecosystem, there arises a need for systems to be added removed seamessly as needed.</p>

        <h2>What are Thing Descriptions?</h2>
        <p>At base value, Thing Descriptions serve to clasify physical devices in a standardized way, breaking them down into three categories.</p>
        <ol>- Actions: Capabilities of the device (e.g., Rotate, light on/off) </ol>
        <ul>- Properties: The device's state of being/settings (e.g., Speed, temperature)</ul>
        <ul>- Events: Notifications that the device sends when certain triggers are stimulated. (e.g., Keystrokes, mouse-click) </ul>
