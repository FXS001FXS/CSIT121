        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>In the simplest of terms, WoT works in favor of creating seamlessly intergrating, interoperale, scalable, and dynamically interacting devices that would otherwise lack IoT connectivity.
        <p>In favor of creating an environment where devices can automatically connect, and discover one and other on the same network, or allow different devices from different manufacturers to communicate using web standards. With this in mind, this will likely be crucial to furthering the use of A.I intergration with technology, allowing interconnection of ever-changing algorithims to intergrate physical tech.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Use</h2>
        <ul>- Seamless Intergration: Intergrated devices will seamlessly connect to one and other without need for complex, manual configuration. </ul>
        <ul>- Interoperability: WoT Discovery allows technologies that are otherwise foreign to one and other to function in a single environment.</ul>
        <ul>- Scalability: The growth of network ecosystems is made massively more efficient.</ul>
        <ul>- Dynamic Interactions: - As per the nature of the system, new devices may be added without bringing interuption to the system's overall function.</ul>
