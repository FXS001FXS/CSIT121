        <p>As for Discovery in particular, regarding WoT, the main goal is to ensure that intergrated devices automatically identify like devices on a network with little need for manual intervention. This is crucial simply because when upscaling the amount of devices in an environment/ecosystem, there arises a need for systems to be added removed seamessly as needed.</p>

        <h2>How does WoT Discovery Function?</h2>
        <ol>- Device Registration: A device/thing is classified via its TD, mainly its actions, properties, events. </ol>
        <ul>- Discovery Request: When an interconnected applications seeks to interact with the 'Thing', it will make a request via HTTP based on certain criteria needed to achieve a certain function.</ul>
        <ul>- Discovery Response: If registered via server, rather than service registry, the server will reply with a list of Things that meet said requirements/criteria, alongisde any neccesary data regarding the devices TD.</ul>   
        <ul>- Interaction: No sooner than the device/thing is discovered, the application can make use of its available actions, or otherwise keep track of the protocols listed in its TD metadata.</ul>
