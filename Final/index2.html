            <h2>Site Organization</h2>
            <p>The site is seemingly well-structured with sections for Products, Solutions, Support, and Resources. The site's accessibility score ranked at 73, having issues mainly around the lack of integrated accessibility for blind and/or deaf people. Many of the pages require tedious scrolling and clicking to reach.</p>

            <h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
            <p>Utilizes contrast effectively, consistent repetition in layout, clear alignment, and logical proximity of information.</p>
            <h2>Accessibility & Recommendations</h2>
            <p>The Cisco Concierge is a rather effective means of navigating the site, yet seeing as its accessibility leaves much to be desired, navigation structure for better user experience is paramount.</p>
