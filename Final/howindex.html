        <h2>How is it used?</h2>
        <p>In its simplest terms, Web of Things (WoT) Discovery regards the identifying and accessing of Internet of Things devices on a single network environment, allowing fluent interaction between their systems. Essentially, this allows internet connectivity with physical devices that would otherwise lack it through standardized web protocols.</p>
        <p>As for Discovery in particular, regarding WoT, the main goal is to ensure that integrated devices automatically identify like devices on a network with little need for manual intervention. This is crucial simply because when upscaling the amount of devices in an environment/ecosystem, there arises a need for systems to be added or removed seamlessly as needed.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>(e.g., Smart Watches are wrist-mounted devices that are capable of keeping track of an individual's heart rate, as well as detecting irregularities, while also maintaining the ability to discover nearby smart healthcare devices.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How does WoT Discovery Function?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Device Registration: A device/thing is classified via its TD, mainly its actions, properties, events.</li>
            <li>Discovery Request: When an interconnected application seeks to interact with the 'Thing', it will make a request via HTTP based on certain criteria needed to achieve a certain function.</li>
            <li>Discovery Response: If registered via server, rather than service registry, the server will reply with a list of Things that meet said requirements/criteria, alongside any necessary data regarding the devices TD.</li>
            <li>Interaction: No sooner than the device/thing is discovered, the application can make use of its available actions, or otherwise keep track of the protocols listed in its TD metadata.</li>
        </ol>
