            <h2>Written Reflection</h2>
            <p>Although eventually overcome, there were a series of challenges that accompanied my efforts to complete this assignment. The bulk of my problem solving efforts came as I initially wondered how to go about ensuring the navigation bar was visible from every  page on my site. The second question I asked myself was how to implement the nav bar in instances where an additional navigation had alredy been present on the page. My method for solving these problems was simple. I assigned a class within my CSS to single out the general site navigation from the nav I implemented individually in certain assignments to sift through information.</p>
            <p>Through a bout of repeated testing and troubleshooting, I was able to verify that my site functioned on various browsers and conveyed all the included information. Furthermore, there were many lessons that I needed to learn while coding. Firstly, I had to understand that when bringing in old code, one may need to 're-reference' the style sheet you intend to use, otherwise, it may not affect the intended HTML file. Secondly, I had to come to understand that leaving filename errors within the navigation bar section will result in site generation errors when switching tabs, likely due to incorrect paths. Additionally, ensuring that images loaded properly proved difficult due to incorrect URLs, ensuring these link errors were fixed proved vital in meeting assignment requirements.</p>
            <p>Having reached the end of the semester, I can genuinely say I've garnered decent understanding of not only HTML but also CSS and perhaps a lesser understanding of JavaScript. This has increased my confidence in regards to coding, further enabling me to engage with new web standards and coding languages without worry.</p>
