        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>In its simplest terms, Web of Things (WoT) Discovery regards the identifying and accessing of Internet of Things devices on a single network environment, allowing fluent interaction between their systems. Essentially, this allows internet connectivity with physical devices that would otherwise lack it through standardized web protocols.</p>
        <p>As for Discovery in particular, regarding WoT, the main goal is to ensure that integrated devices automatically identify like devices on a network with little need for manual intervention. This is crucial simply because when upscaling the number of devices in an environment/ecosystem, there arises a need for systems to be added or removed seamlessly as needed.</p>

        <h2>What are Thing Descriptions?</h2>
        <p>At base value, Thing Descriptions serve to classify physical devices in a standardized way, breaking them down into three categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Actions: Capabilities of the device (e.g., Rotate, light on/off)</li>
            <li>Properties: The device's state of being/settings (e.g., Speed, temperature)</li>
            <li>Events: Notifications that the device sends when certain triggers are stimulated (e.g., Keystrokes, mouse-click)</li>
        </ul>
