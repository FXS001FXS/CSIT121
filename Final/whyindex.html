        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <p>In the simplest of terms, WoT works in favor of creating seamlessly integrating, interoperable, scalable, and dynamically interacting devices that would otherwise lack IoT connectivity.</p>
        <p>In favor of creating an environment where devices can automatically connect, and discover one another on the same network, or allow different devices from different manufacturers to communicate using web standards. With this in mind, this will likely be crucial to furthering the use of A.I integration with technology, allowing interconnection of ever-changing algorithms to integrate physical tech.</p>

        <h2>Benefits of Use</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Seamless Integration: Integrated devices will seamlessly connect to one another without the need for complex, manual configuration.</li>
            <li>Interoperability: WoT Discovery allows technologies that are otherwise foreign to one another to function in a single environment.</li>
            <li>Scalability: The growth of network ecosystems is made massively more efficient.</li>
            <li>Dynamic Interactions: As per the nature of the system, new devices may be added without bringing interruption to the system's overall function.</li>
        </ul>
